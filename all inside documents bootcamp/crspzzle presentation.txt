i,e..if the row and column is greater than or =10 it will
return impossible  

for single word it will check for the length of the word and if
it is within range it will return true

for multiple words it will check whether the index is equal
and if the condition satisfies it will return true
  
i,e..if any index overlaps the actual word then
it will return impossible
