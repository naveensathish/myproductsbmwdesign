1.multiple words
we faced a challenge to check multiple words fitting in a crossword
and we finally given a condition to check the value and the index

we have given a condition if the column and row is greater than 10 
it will return impossible

and it will check for a single word and if the length of the word 
is less than 2 it will return impossible

and for overlapping if any value interupts the actual word it will
it will return false
